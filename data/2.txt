Mr. Dursley, a well-off Englishman, notices strange happenings on his way to work one day.
That night, Albus Dumbledore, the head of a wizardry academy called Hogwarts, meets Professor McGonagall, who also teaches at Hogwarts, and a giant named Hagrid outside the Dursley home.
Dumbledore tells McGonagall that someone named Voldemort has killed a Mr. and Mrs. Potter and tried unsuccessfully to kill their baby son, Harry.
Dumbledore leaves Harry with an explanatory note in a basket in front of the Dursley home.
