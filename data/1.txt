Harry Potter is not a normal boy.
Raised by his cruel Aunt and Uncle, and tormented by his bully of a cousin, Dudley, he has resigned to a life of neglect.
On his eleventh birthday, however, a half-giant called Hagrid comes crashing-–quite literally-–into his life, and announces that Harry is a wizard.
Together they journey to London to get school supplies for Harry’s first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
On 1st September Harry takes a train from King’s Cross station, Platform 9 ¾, to Hogwarts school, where he meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.
The three are sorted into the same House, Gryffindor, and although Harry and Ron find Hermione bossy and annoying at first, the three soon become best friends.
