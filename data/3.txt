Eleven years ago, wizards rejoiced all over the world, and Muggles (non-magic folk) were confused.
They celebrated because He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was defeated.
In other words, Voldemort (the evilest wizard around) killed Harry Potter's parents, but for some strange reason, he couldn't kill little baby Harry.
Now Voldemort seems to have disappeared. Overnight, baby Harry has become a hero â€“ "The Boy Who Lived."
Having lost his family and home, Harry also has become an orphan.
Dumbledore (the principle of Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft), Professor McGonagall (a teacher at Hogwarts), and Hagrid (a groundskeeper at Hogwarts) find a home for baby Harry with his Muggle extended family, the Dursleys.
